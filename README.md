Project3: Garden lover's seed exchange community..

I have a small vegetable garden.
I love to grow the organic vegies and they are so tasty.
I wonder that somebody want to exchange their homegrown vegetable seeds with mine...(by the way, if you plant the GMO plant, we usually can't collect the seeds...because they are design for only one time life cycle..)
